1. Execute a networking command to “change time interval between ping packets”
and “to change ping packet size”.
ping -i 3 hostname # Changes interval to 3 seconds between packets
ping -s 70 hostname # Changes packet size to 70 bytes
2. Execute a networking command to “make ping send set number of packets” and
“make ping print timestamp before each line”.
ping -c 15 hostname # Sends 15 packets then stops
ping -D hostname # Prints timestamp before each line
3. Execute a networking command to “limit the number of network hops” and
“allow super users to send 100 or more packets per second”.
ping -t 10 hostname # Limits network hops to 10
sudo ping -f hostname # Allows superuser to flood network (100+ packets/sec)
4. Execute a networking command “to find the route to the given destination” and
“show IP address do not resolve Host Name”.
traceroute hostname # Find route to destination
traceroute -n hostname # Show IP addresses without resolving hostnames
5. Execute a networking command “ to set response time” and “ to find out IP
address of Domain”.
traceroute -n -w 1 hostname # Sets 1 second response timeout
nslookup hostname # Finds IP address of domain
6. Execute a networking command “to find out specific domain Lookup” and “ to
query Name Server record”.
nslookup domain # Find specific domain lookup
nslookup -query=ns domain # Query nameserver records
7. Execute a networking command “ to list all active listening TCP and UDP ports”
netstat -l # Lists all active listening ports
8. Execute a networking command “to display ARP entries for a particular address
and for an Interface”.
arp -a ipaddress # Display ARP entries for specific address
arp -i interface # Display ARP entries for specific interface

### **Networking Command Questions**

1. **Execute a networking command to change the time interval between ping packets and to change ping packet size.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `ping -i <time_in_seconds> <URL/IP_address>`  
   - `ping -s <packet_size> <URL/IP_address>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `ping -i 3 www.example.com`  
   - `ping -s 70 www.example.com`

2. **Execute a networking command to make ping send a set number of packets and print timestamps before each line.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `ping -c <number_of_packets> <URL/IP_address>`  
   - `ping -D <URL/IP_address>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `ping -c 5 www.example.com`  
   - `ping -D www.example.com`

3. **Execute a networking command to limit the number of network hops and allow superusers to send 100 or more packets per second.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `ping -t <TTL_value> <URL/IP_address>`  
   - `sudo ping -f <URL/IP_address>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `ping -t 10 www.example.com`  
   - `sudo ping -f www.example.com`

4. **Execute a networking command to find the route to a destination and show IP addresses without resolving hostnames.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `traceroute <URL/IP_address>`  
   - `traceroute -n <URL/IP_address>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `traceroute www.example.com`  
   - `traceroute -n www.example.com`

5. **Execute a networking command to set response time and find out the IP address of a domain.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `traceroute -w <time_in_seconds> <URL/IP_address>`  
   - `nslookup <domain_name>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `traceroute -w 1 www.example.com`  
   - `nslookup www.example.com`

6. **Execute a networking command to find a specific domain lookup and query Name Server (NS) records.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `nslookup <domain_name>`  
   - `nslookup -query=ns <domain_name>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `nslookup www.example.com`  
   - `nslookup -query=ns www.example.com`

7. **Execute a networking command to list all active listening TCP and UDP ports.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `netstat -lt` (for TCP)  
   - `netstat -lu` (for UDP)  

   **Example:**  
   - `netstat -lt`  
   - `netstat -lu`

8. **Execute a networking command to display ARP entries for a specific address and interface.**  
   **Command:**  
   - `arp -a <IP_address>`  
   - `arp -i <interface_name>`  

   **Example:**  
   - `arp -a 192.168.0.1`  
   - `arp -i eth0`

### **Theory Summary**
1. **PING:** Checks connectivity between devices using ICMP packets.  
   - Options for interval, packet size, count, timestamp, TTL, etc.

2. **Traceroute:** Tracks the path of packets to a destination, useful for debugging network issues.  
   - Options include disabling hostname resolution, setting timeout, and customizing hop queries.

3. **Telnet:** Enables terminal connections to remote systems, useful for testing remote port connectivity.

4. **Nslookup:** Queries DNS to resolve domain names to IPs or retrieve specific DNS records like MX, NS, etc.

5. **Netstat:** Monitors network connections, routing tables, and active ports.  
   - Includes filters for TCP/UDP and active listening ports.

6. **ARP:** Manages and displays the ARP table, mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses.  
   - Options include filtering by address or interface.

7. **RARP:** Resolves MAC addresses to IP addresses, often used in reverse scenarios.

### **Procedure Highlights**
- Experiment with each command in a Linux terminal or Windows Command Prompt.  
- Modify parameters to observe different outputs and functionalities.  
- Ensure administrative privileges for commands like `sudo ping` or `arp`.
